## Implementing a binary search tree in python
# Needs in-order, pre-order, post-order traversal
# Going to need a tree node, similar to the nodes that I created for my linked lists,
# just instead of prev, and next, i'll hae left and right. SHould probably include tree height just so that I can
# easily transition it into an AVL tree. I think a lot of this can be done with recursion.
