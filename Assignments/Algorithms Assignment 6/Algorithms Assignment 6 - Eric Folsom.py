'''
Implementing a binary search tree in python
 Needs in-order, pre-order, post-order traversal
 Going to need a tree node, similar to the nodes that I created for my linked lists,
 just instead of prev, and next, i'll hae left and right. SHould probably include tree height just so that I can
 easily transition it into an AVL tree. I think a lot of this can be done with recursion. Might try to do this iteratively as well

## Tree Node ##

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data # data we want to add to our tree
        self.left = None # starting as None for now
        self.right = None # starting as None for now
        self.height = 1 # height from that node is 1 by default
        
class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
