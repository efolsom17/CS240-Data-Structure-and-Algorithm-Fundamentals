### CS240 Algorithms Assignment 4 - Eric Folsom ###

'''
Quick Sort was a lot easier for me to wrap my head around than merge sort. I was able to get
a good idea on how merge sort was but it would be a lot easier to explain my understanding in a visual form
versus a written form I am afraid. Thinking about the recursion stack as an absolute value function graph
really helped me get a grasp on what was happening in the algorithm and helped me with my pseudocode and implementation.
