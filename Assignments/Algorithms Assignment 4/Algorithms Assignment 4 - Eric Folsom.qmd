```{python, setup_py}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

# Setup Chunk for python, loading the required libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```


```{r, setup_r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

#Setup Chunk for R and Reticulate so that I can use ggplot if I ever have to graph stuff.
#This will most likely be useful for a later assignment.

library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Problem 1: Write in pseudo code a merge sort algorithm the works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

## Problem 2: Write in the programming language of your choice a merge sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

## Problem 3: Write in pseudo code a quick sort algorithm the works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

## Problem 4: Write in the programming language of your choice a quick sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

## Problem 5: How do the best, average and worst case time complexities compare between these two algorithms?

## Problem 6: Use the uploaded file to verify your sort algorithms are working. `'numbers-4.txt'` What is the position of 90262? What is the position of 11559?
