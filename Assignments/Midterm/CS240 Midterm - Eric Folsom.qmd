## Hanoi's Tower


The Tower of Hanoi problem involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, making a cone.

The goal of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

#### 1. Implement a solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion. Your solution should move the discs from the starting peg to the target peg using the auxiliary peg. 

#### 2. Implement a solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem using an iterative approach.

#### 3. Compare the time and space complexity of both the recursive and iterative solutions and explain the differences.

#### 4. (Optional, but extra credit) Create a graphical user interface (GUI) that demonstrates the steps of the Tower of Hanoi problem as the discs are moved from the starting peg to the target peg. The GUI should allow the user to specify the number of discs and the speed at which the discs move.

#### 5. Create a variation of the Tower of Hanoi problem where the user can specify more than three pegs. Your solution should still move all the discs from the starting peg to the target peg while adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

#### 6. (Optional, but extra credit) Create a variation of the Tower of Hanoi problem where the user can specify the number of discs and the number of pegs. Your solution should still move all the discs from the starting peg to the target peg while adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem.
