# CS240 Spring 2024

## Assignments:

Assignmments are located in the assignments folder, each assignment is its own folder. Assignments which include written responses are produced using Quarto. The Quarto document is knitted as a .html file. The .html file with the
corresponding name is my submission for that assignment. Alternatively, Quarto has a similar style to markdown documents if you would like to just read the raw Quarto document. To Knit the document you will need [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Additionally, any code produced or sample data used will be included. The data is stored in the Data folder within each assignment. Some Assignments do not have written responses and will only contain the data folder and the code for the assignment.
